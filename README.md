# KIRHelperKit
This project includes the KIRHelperKit (see [KIRHelperKit](KIRHelperKit/README.md)) alongside with two small compiler plugins used for a case study.

## stringbuilder_plugin
This plugin saves the name of each function for each invocation to a stringbuilder and prints the resulting string at the end of the main function.
This plugin is used to explain the general workings of the KIRHelperKit.

## atomic_int_plugin
This plugin increases an atomic integer each time a function is invoked and prints the resulting value at the end of the main function.
This plugin should be implemented by the colleges in my case study.
